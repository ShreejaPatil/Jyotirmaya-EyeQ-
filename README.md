Project Abstract: An AI-powered mobile/web module for early detection of eye health issues such as cataract, squint, and allergies. The system allows patients to capture an eye image using a smartphone, processes it with ML models, and generates a preliminary diagnostic report. With user consent, the solution also generates qualified leads for Galaxy Hospital and enables direct online appointment booking. In collaboration with the Dhole Foundation, the project aims to improve accessibility of preventive healthcare, particularly in underserved communities.
